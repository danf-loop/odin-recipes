        <p>Need a simple comfort-food lunch? This lasagna-in-a-bowl wants to be your friend. 
            Great when cooking for one. Here is the ingredients you need::</p>


        <ul>
            <li> 2 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup marinara sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Breakdown of the steps to follow:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Break each lasagna noodle into 6 rectangular pieces. Place noodles in a 4-cup microwave-safe bowl. Add water, making sure noodles are covered and water level is about halfway up the bowl. 
                Place the bowl on a microwave-safe plate.</li>
            <li>Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir pasta quickly to keep it from clumping. Cook in 2-minute increments, stirring in between, and emptying any water that has boiled over onto the plate. Repeat until lasagna is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes total. Drain noodles, reserving 1 tablespoon of the cooking liquid. 
                Return noodles and reserved liquid to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir marinara sauce and chopped tomatoes into the bowl, mixing until incorporated. Sprinkle on basil, and then mozzarella cheese. Cover surface of the bowl with a paper towel to prevent splatter and microwave until cheese is completely melted and tomato sauce is warmed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. 
                Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
